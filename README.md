PowerPress Token Authentication
=======

A WordPress plugin that works with the Blubrry [Powerpress][1] plugin to create a token authentication system for use with mobile devices/etc. on private feeds.

On devices such as iOS devices, password-protected RSS feeds are unsupported, so the problem is resolved by using a hash token to validate the user instead.

Requirements
------------
Besides the obvious, it requires [Blubrry PowerPress][2] >= 4.0.9.
