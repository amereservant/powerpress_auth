PowerPress Alternative Authorization
=======

A WordPress plugin that works with the Blubrry [Powerpress][1] plugin to create a token authentication system for use with mobile devices/etc. on private feeds.

On devices such as iOS devices, password-protected RSS feeds are unsupported, so the problem is resolved by using a hash token to validate the user instead.

This plugin also integrates easier control over user's who can access **Premium Content** *(as it's called)* and also simplifies marking posts as Premium Content.

Requirements
------------
Besides the obvious, it requires [Blubrry PowerPress][2] >= 4.0.9.
